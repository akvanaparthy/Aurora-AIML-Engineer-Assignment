# Vector Search Configuration

# Adaptive Search Strategy Configuration
# The system automatically classifies queries as "specific" or "broad"
# and adjusts search parameters accordingly

# SPECIFIC QUERIES (Precision-focused)
# Examples: "How many cars does Vikram have?", "When is Layla's London trip?", "What did Amira say on Dec 15?"
# Characteristics: Mentions specific user names, dates, locations, or items
# Goal: Highly precise, focused results
SPECIFIC_QUERY_TOP_K=50
SPECIFIC_QUERY_THRESHOLD=0.7

# BROAD QUERIES (Recall-focused)
# Examples: "What do members prefer for dining?", "What are popular travel destinations?", "Who travels frequently?"
# Characteristics: General questions, no specific entities, often asks about "members" or patterns
# Goal: Comprehensive coverage across multiple users
BROAD_QUERY_TOP_K=120
BROAD_QUERY_THRESHOLD=0.5

# Context Configuration
MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=20000
# Maximum tokens to send to Claude (balance between quality and cost)
# 20K tokens ≈ 300-500 messages of context
# Recommended range: 10000-30000
# Cost at 20K: ~$0.006 per request (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

NO_LIMITS_TEST=false
# Set to true to disable all the token, truncate limits to get to know how original answer might be if we send all the data - for testing purposes only
